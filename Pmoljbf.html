            <h2>What is a Pmoljbf?</h2>
            <p>A Pmoljbf (Peeemohelus Jaybeeefus) is a wild lime creature with a monocle, bowtie, and a top hat. These are found in the wild outbacks of Australia and can be very difficult to handle. Although cute, they can get into a lot of havoc when it comes to keeping one as they are extremely hyper and angry. They cannot hurt you in any way, but can do serious mental/emotional attacks when provoked.</p>
